## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from ai_security_system import SecureMLModel
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
X = np.random.randn(1000, 10)
y = (X[:, 0] + X[:, 1] > 0).astype(int)

# Initialize secure model
model = SecureMLModel('random_forest')

# Setup access control
model.access_control.add_user('admin', 'secure_password', 'admin')

# Train with adversarial protection
results = model.train(X, y, use_adversarial_training=True, 
                     username='admin', password='secure_password')

# Make secure predictions
predictions, security_info = model.predict_secure(X[:10], 
                                                 username='admin', 
                                                 password='secure_password')
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **DataEncryption**
- Password hashing with salt
- Differential privacy noise generation
- Secure random number generation

#### 2. **AccessControl**
- User management with encrypted passwords
- Role-based permissions (admin, user, viewer)
- Access logging and audit trails

#### 3. **AdversarialDefense**
- FGSM-style adversarial sample generation
- Confidence-based attack detection
- Configurable attack thresholds

#### 4. **SecureMLModel**
- Main orchestration class
- Secure training pipeline
- Protected inference with monitoring

### Mathematical Foundations

The implementation includes the key formulas from the paper:

**Formula 1 - Random Forest Classification:**
```
T = {T‚ÇÅ(x), T‚ÇÇ(x), ..., T‚Çô(x)}
```
Where T_i(x) is the classification result of the i-th decision tree.

**Formula 2 - Variance Calculation for Feature Selection:**
```
G = Œ£(x·µ¢ - Œº)¬≤ / n
```
Where G is variance, x·µ¢ is the i-th data point, Œº is the mean, and n is the number of data points.

**Formula 3 - Information Gain:**
```
IG = H(Y) - H(Y|X)
```
Where H(Y) is entropy of target variable and H(Y|X) is conditional entropy.

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks multiple security and performance metrics:

- **Normal Accuracy**: Model performance on clean data
- **Adversarial Accuracy**: Model performance on adversarial examples
- **Attack Success Rate**: Percentage of successful adversarial attacks
- **Privacy Leakage Rate**: Measure of information leakage (1-1.8% typical)

## User Roles and Permissions

| Role | Permissions | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **admin** | read, write, delete, execute | Full system access |
| **user** | read, write | Can train models and make predictions |
| **viewer** | read | Read-only access to results |

## Configuration

### Differential Privacy
```python
# Adjust privacy level (lower epsilon = more privacy)
model.encryptor.add_differential_privacy_noise(data, epsilon=0.5)
```

### Adversarial Defense
```python
# Adjust attack detection sensitivity
model.adversarial_defense.attack_detection_threshold = 0.15
```

### Access Control
```python
# Add custom roles
model.access_control.roles['analyst'] = ['read', 'execute']
model.access_control.add_user('analyst1', 'password', 'analyst')
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords for all user accounts
2. **Regular Monitoring**: Review access logs regularly for suspicious activity
3. **Privacy Tuning**: Adjust epsilon values based on privacy requirements
4. **Model Updates**: Retrain models periodically with new adversarial examples
5. **Threshold Tuning**: Calibrate attack detection thresholds for your use case
